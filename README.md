# Knuth-Morris-Pratt-searcher
The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is a linear-time string-matching algorithm that efficiently searches for occurrences of a pattern in a text. It improves upon the naive approach by preprocessing the pattern to create a partial match table (failure function or lps array), which helps skip unnecessary comparisons.
